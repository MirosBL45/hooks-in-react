Hello :)

These are examples of hooks that are part of the React Front To Back Udemy course by Brad Traversy. It is interesting to see how some infrequent hooks are used.

There are some examples:
a) 3 hooks of useRef
b) useMemo hook
c) useCallback hook
d) Custom Hook 1 - useFetch
e) Custom Hook 2 - useLocalStorage

Any advice is wellcome :)
